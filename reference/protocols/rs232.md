# RS-232 quick reference

## Basics
- Point-to-point serial, single-ended; common levels: +-3 to +-12 V.
- Common settings: 9600/19200 8N1; check device docs.
- Max length typically <15 m at high baud; longer possible at lower speeds with good cable.

## Wiring
- DE9: TxD (pin 3), RxD (pin 2), GND (pin 5); crossover often needed between DTE/DCE.
- Null modem for DTE-DTE: cross Tx/Rx, loop handshaking as required (RTS/CTS, DTR/DSR).

## Test strings
- Loopback test: short Tx to Rx and send `TEST` to confirm echo.
- Simple query (example proprietary): `STATUS?\r\n` (device-specific).

## Tips
- Avoid ground loops; use isolated adapters if needed.
- Set correct handshaking (none, RTS/CTS, or DTR/DSR).
