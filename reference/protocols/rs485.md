# RS-485 quick reference

## Basics
- Multi-drop differential bus; half-duplex 2-wire (A/B) or full-duplex 4-wire.
- Common for Modbus RTU. Requires line termination and biasing.

## Wiring
- 2-wire: A/B pair shared; 120 ohm termination at both physical ends.
- Bias: pull-up on A(+), pull-down on B(-) to hold idle state; some devices provide built-in bias/termination.
- Shielded twisted pair recommended; maintain polarity.

## Timing
- Respect 3.5 character silent interval between Modbus RTU frames; avoid inter-char gaps >1.5 char.

## Test string
- Send Modbus RTU request `01 03 00 6B 00 03 76 87` and expect reply if bus healthy.

## Tips
- Only two terminations (bus ends). Avoid star topologies.
- Verify driver direction control on adapters (DE/RE) if not auto-turnaround.
