# Fire extinguisher reference (UK maritime/industrial)

## Classes of fire
- Class A: solid combustibles (wood, paper, textiles, plastics).
- Class B: flammable liquids (diesel, petrol, solvents, oils, paints).
- Class C: flammable gases (LPG, natural gas, acetylene, hydrogen).
- Class D: combustible metals (magnesium, lithium, sodium, potassium).
- Class F: cooking oils/fats.
- Electrical: energized electrical equipment (de-energize first when possible).

## Extinguisher types, colours, and use
- Water (red): Class A; do not use on electrical, liquid, gas, or metal fires.
- Foam (cream band): Class A, B; limited splash risk; avoid live electrics unless electrically rated (dielectric tested). Electrically rated AFFF/foam can be used on low-voltage gear per rating.
- Dry powder/ABC (blue band): Class A, B, C, electrical; not for Class F; avoid confined spaces (visibility/respiratory); not for metal fires unless METAL powder; leaves residue on equipment.
- CO2 (black band): Electrical, Class B; limited cooling, re-flash possible; avoid confined spaces and stay upwind of discharge.
- Wet chemical (yellow band): Class F; also Class A on small solids; not for liquids, gas, metal, or electrics unless rated.
- Metal/L2/Lithium (signal word "METAL"): Class D only; match powder to metal; do not use other agents on metal fires.

## Common locations and suitable extinguishers
- Server/controls container (230 V small electrics, laptops, no lithium storage): Electrically rated AFFF/foam (EN3 35 kV) or water mist preferred; CO2 only if ventilated/unoccupied and attended; avoid ABC powder on electronics; isolate power.
- Ship machinery/local machinery space: Foam for Class A/B, CO2 for electrical panels/motors, ABC powder for mixed risk; avoid powder near sensitive air intakes if possible.
- Galley/combination oven/fryer: Wet chemical for Class F, CO2 for nearby electrics; avoid powder in food prep areas.
- Accommodation/office spaces: Water mist or foam for Class A; CO2 for small electrical points.
- Deck fuel transfer/bunkering: Foam (A/B) for liquid spills; CO2 for electrical cabinets; powder for wide coverage outdoors.
- Workshop/hot work area: ABC powder for mixed fuels; CO2 for electrical tools; secure cylinders and clear ignition sources.
- Industrial warehouse (general goods): Water/foam for Class A; foam or powder near stored liquids; CO2 for electrical cabinets.

## Quick selection
- Live electrics: Water mist or electrically rated AFFF/foam; CO2 only if ventilated/unoccupied; dry powder only if no alternative and accept contamination; isolate power.
- Flammable liquids: Foam or dry powder; CO2 for small enclosed risks; avoid water.
- Flammable gases: Dry powder; isolate supply; avoid CO2/water/foam.
- Cooking oils/fats: Wet chemical only; isolate heat.
- Combustible metals: Metal-specific extinguisher only.
