# RS-422 quick reference

## Basics
- Balanced differential pairs; typically point-to-point (1 driver, 1 receiver) over longer distances (hundreds of meters) and higher baud than RS-232.
- Often used with Modbus RTU when only two nodes are present.

## Wiring
- Pair A/B (sometimes marked + / -). Keep consistent polarity across devices.
- Optional sense/ground reference to reduce common-mode issues.
- Termination: 120 ohm at receiver end; biasing usually not required with single driver.

## Test string
- Send a known Modbus RTU frame (see modbus-rtu.md) across the pair and verify response.

## Tips
- Maintain twisted pair and shield continuity; avoid crossing A/B.
- Check labeling: some vendors invert A/B naming.
